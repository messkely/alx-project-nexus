# Project Nexus Documentation

Welcome to the **Project Nexus Documentation Repository** – a comprehensive guide to the backend engineering concepts, technologies, and practices learned throughout the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

This repository serves as a documentation hub to:

- Consolidate major backend learnings.
- Document technologies, tools, challenges, and solutions.
- Act as a reference guide for future learners.
- Foster collaboration between frontend and backend learners.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Covered

### 🔹 Programming Languages & Frameworks
- **Python** – Core language used for backend development.
- **Django** – High-level Python web framework.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – For building RESTful APIs.
- **GraphQL** – Alternative to REST for efficient data fetching.

### 🔹 DevOps & Deployment Tools
- **Docker** – Containerization and deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)** – Automating testing and deployment.

### 🔹 Databases & Caching
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database used for structured data.
- **Redis** – In-memory caching for performance optimization.

### 🔹 Background Task Management
- **Celery** – Asynchronous task queue.
- **RabbitMQ** – Message broker used with Celery.

## 📚 Core Backend Concepts Learned

### ✅ RESTful APIs
- Endpoint design with views, serializers, and routers.
- Authentication (JWT), pagination, filtering, and permissions.
- Proper HTTP methods and status codes.

### ✅ GraphQL APIs
- Schema-first API design with query and mutation support.
- Efficient client-driven data retrieval.

### ✅ Database Design
- Modeling relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
- Normalization and indexing for performance.
- Using Django ORM for query optimization.

### ✅ Asynchronous Programming
- Offloading heavy tasks with Celery.
- Scheduling periodic tasks.
- Queue management with RabbitMQ.

### ✅ Caching Strategies
- Caching external API calls and computed data with Redis.
- Avoiding redundant DB hits for performance gains.

### ✅ CI/CD Pipelines
- Automating tests with GitHub Actions.
- Streamlined deployment pipelines for continuous delivery.

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Handling slow external API responses | Implemented Redis caching and timeout management |
| Securing API endpoints | Used JWT authentication and permission classes |
| Managing long-running tasks | Integrated Celery + RabbitMQ for background jobs |
| Keeping API performance high | Used pagination, indexing, and caching |
| Collaborating in teams | Used GitHub flow, Trello boards, and Discord syncs |

---

## 🌟 Best Practices & Takeaways

- **Modular Codebase**: Followed separation of concerns (views, serializers, services).
- **Version Control**: Used branches and PRs to manage development flow.
- **Testing**: Wrote unit and integration tests for core logic.
- **Documentation**: Adopted Swagger/OpenAPI for clear API docs.
- **Security First**: Applied auth, input validation, and rate-limiting.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

### 👥 Collaborators
- **Backend Developers**: Shared APIs, discussed architecture, solved blockers.
- **Frontend Developers**: Coordinated on API structure and expected responses.

## 📌 Tips for Future Learners

- Don’t skip CI/CD – it saves time and improves quality.
- Design your database carefully from the beginning.
- Always test API endpoints with Postman or Swagger.
- Use caching to boost performance for read-heavy endpoints.
- Collaborate early with frontend developers for smoother integration.
